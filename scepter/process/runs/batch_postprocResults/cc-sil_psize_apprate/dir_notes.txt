# meanAnn_shortrun_*__001
- cc vs gbas
- counterfactual cc
- same, low upstream emissions for each


# meanAnn_shortrun_*__002
- cc vs gbas
- counterfactual cc
- gbas LCA emissions > cc LCA emissions


# meanAnn_shortrun_*__003
- cc vs gbas
- counterfactual cc
- gbas LCA emissions < cc LCA emissions


# meanAnn_shortrun_*__004
- cc vs gbas
- counterfactual cc (so low that it's emitting in hiFert case)
- same, low upstream emissions for each


# meanAnn_shortrun_*__005
- cc vs gbas
- counterfactual cc
- gbas LCA emissions << cc LCA emissions


# meanAnn_shortrun_*__006
- cc vs gbas
- counterfactual cc (so low that it's emitting in hiFert case)
- gbas LCA emissions << cc LCA emissions


# meanAnn_shortrun_*__007
- cc vs gbas
- counterfactual cc (so low that it's emitting in hiFert case)
- gbas LCA emissions > cc LCA emissions


# meanAnn_shortrun_*__008  FAILED -- same as 006


# meanAnn_shortrun_*__009 ( now with simple subtract, no neg ! )
- cc vs gbas
- counterfactual cc (so low that it's emitting in hiFert case)
- gbas LCA emissions << cc LCA emissions


# meanAnn_shortrun_*__010 ( same as 001 but with simple subtract, no neg ! )
- cc vs gbas
- counterfactual cc
- same, low upstream emissions for each


# meanAnn_shortrun_*__011 ( now with simple subtract, no neg ! )
- cc vs gbas
- counterfactual cc (higher app so net R in hi and lowFert ~1.5 ton/ha/yr)
- same, low upstream emissions for each


# meanAnn_shortrun_*__012 ( now with simple subtract, no neg ! )
- cc vs gbas
- counterfactual cc (~0.4 ton/ha/yr)
- same, low upstream emissions for each
